## Project Description

SNApp is a lightweight note-taking web application designed to replace a legacy [AngularJS-based
notes app](https://github.com/SNApp-notes/web-legacy). It offers a user-friendly, three-panel
interface where:

- The left panel displays a searchable list of note titles.
- The middle panel provides a Markdown editor with syntax highlighting.
- The right panel shows a summary with header navigation and filtering.

Key features include:

- **User Authentication:** Sign in exclusively via GitHub OAuth for secure access.
- **Onboarding:** A pre-populated example note is created upon first login to help users understand
  core functionalities.
- **Notes Management:** Create, rename, edit (with live Markdown preview), and delete notes.
- **User Settings:** Toggle dark mode and delete account with email confirmation.
- **Analytics:** Anonymous tracking through secure, server-side logging without collecting personal
  data.

## Getting Started Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jcubic/10xDevs.git
   cd 10xDevs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Copy the example environment file and update with your values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and configure the following variables:

   **Database Configuration (Required):**
   - `DATABASE_URL`: MySQL/MariaDB connection string
     ```
     DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/snapp"
     ```

   **Better Auth Configuration (Required):**
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: Secret key for session encryption (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
   - `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: Backend authentication URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL`: Public-facing authentication URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

   **GitHub OAuth (Required):**

   Create a GitHub OAuth app at [https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Set Authorization callback URL to: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
   - Configure the following variables:
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Your GitHub OAuth app client ID
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your GitHub OAuth app client secret

   **SMTP Configuration (Optional, for email verification):**
   - `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`: Sender email address (e.g., `noreply@snapp.dev`)
   - `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP server hostname (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
   - `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port (e.g., `587` for TLS)
   - `SMTP_USERNAME`: SMTP authentication username
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP authentication password

4. **Set up the database:**

   Run Prisma migrations to create the database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --schema ./prisma-main/schema.prisma
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Testing

This project uses a comprehensive testing strategy with separate database configurations for different environments.

### Testing Architecture

**Two-Database Approach:**

- **Production/Development**: MySQL/MariaDB (configured via `prisma-main/schema.prisma`)
- **Testing**: SQLite (configured via `prisma-e2e/schema.prisma`)

The application automatically switches between databases based on `NODE_ENV`:

- `NODE_ENV=test` → Uses SQLite (`test-vitest.db` for unit tests, `test-e2e.db` for E2E tests)
- Otherwise → Uses MySQL/MariaDB from `DATABASE_URL`

### Unit and Integration Tests

**Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library

Unit and integration tests use SQLite for fast, isolated testing without requiring MySQL setup.

**Run tests:**

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI (requires @vitest/ui)
npm run test:ui
```

**Key Features:**

- Automatic SQLite database setup and cleanup
- No manual database configuration required
- Fast test execution with in-memory operations
- Tests located next to source files (e.g., `Component.test.tsx`)

### End-to-End Tests

**Framework:** Playwright

E2E tests verify complete user workflows including authentication, note management, and UI interactions.

**Local E2E Testing (Linux/macOS/Windows):**

```bash
# Run E2E tests locally
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with Playwright UI for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

**Requirements:**

- Playwright browsers installed (`npx playwright install`)
- Supported operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Docker-Based E2E Testing

**For Unsupported Systems (e.g., Fedora):**

On systems where Playwright binaries are not available, use Docker for E2E testing with an isolated environment.

**Setup:**

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose** on your system

2. **Build the Docker image** (first time only, or after modifying Docker files):

   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:docker:build
   ```

   This builds the Docker image with:
   - Node.js runtime
   - Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - All project dependencies
   - Isolated SQLite test database

3. **Run E2E tests in Docker:**

   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:docker
   ```

**Docker Architecture:**

- **Image**: Ubuntu-based with Playwright dependencies pre-installed
- **Database**: Isolated SQLite database (`test-e2e.db`) created fresh for each test run
- **Network**: Isolated Docker network for secure testing
- **Cleanup**: Automatic container and volume cleanup after tests complete

**When to Rebuild Docker Image:**

```bash
# After modifying e2e/Dockerfile or e2e/docker-compose.yml
npm run test:e2e:docker:build

# After updating dependencies
npm run test:e2e:docker:build
```

**Docker Configuration Files:**

- `e2e/Dockerfile` - Docker image definition
- `e2e/docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- `e2e/playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration

## Project Scope

**In Scope:**

- GitHub OAuth authentication for secure, personalized access.
- Basic CRUD operations for note management (create, read, update, delete).
- A three-panel interface for effective note navigation and editing.
- An onboarding example that introduces app features.
- Dark mode toggle with persistent user settings.
- Anonymous analytics using server-side logging.

**Out of Scope (for MVP):**

- Offline access or local synchronization.
- Advanced features like drag-and-drop, full-text search, or exporting notes.
- Multiple authentication methods (only GitHub OAuth is supported).
- Client-side encryption and advanced user management features.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the MVP stage, focusing on core functionalities and rapid
development. Future enhancements are planned to expand usability and add advanced features based on
user feedback.
