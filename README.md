## Project Description

SNApp is a lightweight note-taking web application designed to replace a legacy [AngularJS-based
notes app](https://github.com/SNApp-notes/web-legacy). It offers a user-friendly, three-panel
interface where:

- The left panel displays a searchable list of note titles.
- The middle panel provides a Markdown editor with syntax highlighting.
- The right panel shows a summary with header navigation and filtering.

Key features include:

- **User Authentication:** Sign in exclusively via GitHub OAuth for secure access.
- **Onboarding:** A pre-populated example note is created upon first login to help users understand
  core functionalities.
- **Notes Management:** Create, rename, edit (with live Markdown preview), and delete notes.
- **User Settings:** Toggle dark mode and delete account with email confirmation.
- **Analytics:** Anonymous tracking through secure, server-side logging without collecting personal
  data.

## Tech Stack

**Front-End:**

- Next.js 15
- React 19

## Project Scope

**In Scope:**

- GitHub OAuth authentication for secure, personalized access.
- Basic CRUD operations for note management (create, read, update, delete).
- A three-panel interface for effective note navigation and editing.
- An onboarding example that introduces app features.
- Dark mode toggle with persistent user settings.
- Anonymous analytics using server-side logging.

**Out of Scope (for MVP):**

- Offline access or local synchronization.
- Advanced features like drag-and-drop, full-text search, or exporting notes.
- Multiple authentication methods (only GitHub OAuth is supported).
- Client-side encryption and advanced user management features.

## Project Status
