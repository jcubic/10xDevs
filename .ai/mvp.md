# Application SNApp (MVP)

### Main problem

The easiest way to save text based notes are text files on your hard drive. But I want to have access to my text based notes also when I don't have access to my own computer.

The inital version of the notes taking application, that I'm using, was created with now legacy technology AngularJS and can't be updated anymore, probably because of broken dependencies. So I want rewrite the app,
and in the future add more features that are not possible with AngularJS project.

### Minimal functionality

Functionality from old application:

- Creating a list of notes, each note can have a name
- Notes are text files
- You can rename the note
- You can edit and save notes
- There are simple user accounts for the notes
- Notes are private accesible only from your account
- Basic filter of notes by name
- Navigation inside a single note by locating headers in sidebar
- Basic filter of found headers in sidebar
- Markdown syntax highliting

### What's not included in MVP

- Categories and Notes Tree
- Drag & Drop of notes and categories in Tree
- Notes sorting
- Full text search
- Notes sharing/publishing

### Success criteria

- Users can create and orgnize their notes
- Users can filer for the note they need
- Users can navigate inside a single note
